# Tendable Sample Project

Hi, this is a sample Project for Exercise for Tendable.

To execute the code, you can run the command `mvn clean test-compile test`

You may be wondering why i have added clean and test-compile, the reason is that i want the target folder to be deleted and code to be compiled for test purpose before executing.

This is a basic PageObjectModel Based project which has minimal reporting to allow logs and screenshots.

Project is GRID Ready
Project is Mac, Windows and Linux Compatible.
Minimal Hardcoding of paths.
Extent Reports for Reporting

You can play around with the `src/test/resources/environment.properties` file.

Note: To run on Grid, you need to provide the Correct GRID Server URL and make sure it is running before you execute the code.
